* General Information

The *Bad OO Acoustics simulation toolbox (booast)* provides some means
for simulating acoustic problems using Octave or Matlab(tm).

In particular, it provides two new matlab/octave classes, *vector* and
*vectorgrid*. These can be used to implement arrays of vectors
pointing to a location in $\mathcal R^3$. 

* Installation

Add the path to Octave/Matlab where you installed booast. E.g.
: addpath('path/to/booast/');
